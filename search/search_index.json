The lack of standardized and open-source tools for applying the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria to time series, requires researchers to implement classification algorithms of their own which is resource intensive and might impact study quality by introducing different interpretations of edge cases. This project introduces pyAKI, an open-source pipeline addressing this gap by providing a comprehensive solution for consistent KDIGO criteria implementation.   Materials and methods The pyAKI pipeline was developed and validated using a subset of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, a commonly used database in critical care research. We constructed a standardized data model in order to ensure reproducibility. PyAKI implements the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline on AKI diagnosis. After implementation of the diagnostic algorithm, using both serum creatinine and urinary output data, pyAKI was tested on a subset of patients and diagnostic accuracy was compared in a comparative analysis against annotations by physicians.   Results Validation against expert annotations demonstrated pyAKI\u2019s robust performance in implementing KDIGO criteria. Comparative analysis revealed its ability to surpass the quality of human labels with an accuracy of 1.0 in all categories.   Discussion The pyAKI pipeline is the first open-source solution for implementing KDIGO criteria in time series data. It provides a standardized data model and a comprehensive solution for consistent AKI classification in research applications for clinicians and data scientists working with AKI data. The pipeline\u2019s high accuracy make it a valuable tool for clinical research and decision support systems.   Conclusion This work introduces pyAKI as an open-source solution for implementing the KDIGO criteria for AKI diagnosis using time series data with high accuracy and performance.},\n    number = {1},\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"getting_started/citing/#preprint","title":"Preprint","text":"<p>Our preprint is available on Arxiv.</p> <pre><code>@misc{porschen2024pyakiopensource,\n      title={pyAKI -- An Open Source Solution to Automated KDIGO classification},\n      author={Christian Porschen and Jan Ernsting and Paul Brauckmann and Raphael Weiss and Till W\u00fcrdemann and Hendrik Booke and Wida Amini and Ludwig Maidowski and Benjamin Risse and Tim Hahn and Thilo von Groote},\n      year={2024},\n      eprint={2401.12930},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.LG},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12930},\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"getting_started/contributing/","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>Here is how you can contribute to this project.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/contributing/#setup","title":"Setup","text":"<p>Use the included dev container to automatically install all the necessary dev tools and dependencies.</p> <p>Prerequisite: To use this you first need to install docker under Linux, MacOS or WSL2 under windows.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Clone the repository: <pre><code>git clone git+https://github.com/aidh-ms/pyAKI\ncd pyAKI\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Open the project in Visual Studio Code: <pre><code>code .\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Reopen in Container:</p> <ul> <li>Press <code>F1</code> to open the command palette.</li> <li>Type <code>Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container</code> and select it.</li> <li>VS Code will build the Docker container defined in the <code>.devcontainer</code> folder and open the project inside the container.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"getting_started/contributing/#development","title":"Development","text":""},{"location":"getting_started/contributing/#testing","title":"Testing","text":"<p>To test your contribution, you can use the testing tap in the VS code or utilise the following command to run the unit tests for this project:</p> <pre><code>poetry run pytest .\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"getting_started/installation/","title":"Installing pyAKI","text":""},{"location":"getting_started/installation/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>The supported Python versions for this Python library are the following: * 3.12 * 3.13</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/installation/#installing-from-pypi","title":"Installing from PyPI","text":"<p>The pyAKI library can be installed from PyPI using various package managers.</p> <p>With pip <pre><code>pip install pyAKI\n</code></pre></p> <p>With poetry <pre><code>poetry add pyAKI\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"getting_started/installation/#installing-from-source","title":"Installing from Source","text":"<p>The pyAKI library can be installed from source (GitHub).</p> <p>With pip <pre><code>pip install git+https://github.com/aidh-ms/pyAKI\n</code></pre></p> <p>With poetry <pre><code>poetry add git+https://github.com/aidh-ms/pyAKI\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"getting_started/installation/#dependencies","title":"Dependencies","text":"<p>This library has the following dependencies:</p> <ul> <li>Pandas</li> <li>SciPy</li> <li>Typer</li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting_started/overview/","title":"Package overview","text":"<p>Python package to detect AKI within time series data.</p> <p>The goal of this package is to establish well tested, comprehensive functions for the detection of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in time series data, according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Criteria, established in 2012 <sup>1</sup>. </p>"},{"location":"getting_started/overview/#license","title":"License","text":"<pre><code>MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2023 AIDH MS\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
