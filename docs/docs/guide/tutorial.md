# Introduction to pyAKI

Welcome to the **pyAKI** tutorial! This guide will help you understand how to use the **pyAKI** Python package for **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) detection** based on **creatinine levels, urine output, and renal replacement therapy (RRT) data**.

This tutorial is divided into three sections:

1. **[Using Probes](probes.md)** - Learn how to apply different probe methods to analyze AKI.
2. **[Preprocessing Functions](preprocessing.md)** - Learn about data preparation techniques before analysis.
